## Cloud migration

We can help you migrate your infrastructure from your data centers or other cloud providers to AWS. We recommend our customers pick on or more of 
the strategies below for cloud migration - popularly known as 6 Rs:

1. Rehosting — Otherwise known as “lift-and-shift.”
1. Replatforming — We sometimes call this “lift-tinker-and-shift.”
1. Repurchasing — Moving to a different product.
1. Refactoring / Re-architecting — Re-imagining how the application is architected and developed, typically using cloud-native features.
1. Retire — Get rid of.
1. Retain — Usually this means “revisit” or do nothing (for now).

You can read  more about the strategies at [6 Strategies for Migrating Applications to the Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/6-strategies-for-migrating-applications-to-the-cloud/)

Our team follows the best practices for migration by AWS and can help you pick of the above strategies.
