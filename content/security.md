# Cloud security

Before migrating to the cloud, it is important to understand AWS’ cloud security model.  Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.  To summarize, AWS is responsible for “Security of the Cloud” while the customer is responsible for “Security in the Cloud”.  AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS cloud.  Infrastructure includes hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS cloud services.   For AWS customers, responsibility is determined by the AWS cloud services that a customer selects. For Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products such as EC2, customers are responsible for management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches) and configuration of security groups.

# Security Assessments

Leveraging a number of tools, we ensure you are secure in the cloud. 

Security Assessments 
Our level 1 cloud security assessment is based on the Center of Internet Security’s (CIS) benchmark for securing Amazon Web Services (AWS).  We will perform a review of your AWS cloud architecture to assess your current security posture.  

Our multi-point assessment checklist includes the following – 

- Assessing for vulnerable software versions installed
- Use of data encryption
- Identity and access management (IAM) configuration
- Ensuring event logging with CloudTrail is enabled
- Use of CloudWatch for monitoring
- VPC security configurations

Our level 2 security assessment goes beyond assessing based on the CIS benchmark.  For customers looking to adhere to specific security frameworks requirements such as FEDRAMP, PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC2 or ISO 27001, we conduct our level 2 security assessments with the goal of helping you reach compliance at speed.
