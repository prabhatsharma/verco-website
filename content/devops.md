## Microservices

If you are leveraging Containers in your deployments, developing a Microservices architecture is important for your containerized applications.  Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.  These services are broken down and owned by small, self-contained teams. 

We develop a well designed architecture that implements a system of multiple, relatively small applications that work together to provide the overall functionality of your system.  This deconstruction allows for each functionality component to be updated and deployed without affecting the other parts of the application.
