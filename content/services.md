With our DevOps as a service offering, we ensure rapid on-boarding of applications by automating end-to-end delivery pipeline and facilitating continuous integration and development across AWS cloud platforms.

With our DevOps consulting, we help large enterprises, SMBs, and startups align their development and operations to achieve higher efficiency, faster time to market, and better quality of software builds.  

We help companies build better software by leaving manual processes behind and embaracing an automated, collaborative, and agile way of working.  Our goal is to increase your organization’s speed, reliability, and efficiency.  

## Containers and Kubernetes

<b>Kubernetes Infrastructure Design: </b> We build your Kubernetes clusters using proven design patterns which includes – continuous integration and delivery, shared services components, monitoring, logging 

<b>Kubernetes Cluster Inspection:</b> Our Kubernetes experts will review your K8 configurations to ensure you’re following Kubernetes security and configuration best practices while preparing to deploy your clusters to production

<b>Kubernetes on AWS: </b> Our expertise is in AWS, so we can deploy your Kubernetes infrastructure on AWS

<b>Kubernetes Managed Support</b> Once your clusters are in production, we can provide 24/7 Kubernetes managed support for your Kubernetes infrastructure

## Microservices

If you are leveraging Containers in your deployments, developing a Microservices architecture is important for your containerized applications.  Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.  These services are broken down and owned by small, self-contained teams. 

We develop a well designed architecture that implements a system of multiple, relatively small applications that work together to provide the overall functionality of your system.  This deconstruction allows for each functionality component to be updated and deployed without affecting the other parts of the application.
